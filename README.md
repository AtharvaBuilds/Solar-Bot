SolarBot: A Dual-Mode, Bluetooth-Enabled Two-
Wheel Robot Powered by Renewable Energy 
The system is designed with an L298N motor driver, an Arduino microcontroller, and an HC-05 Bluetooth module, providing the robot with both autonomous and manual control capabilities. The solar panel, integrated with a charging module and voltage regulator, is mounted on a zero PCB, ensuring a sustainable and uninterrupted power supply. The robot is equipped with ultrasonic sensors, enabling it to detect and navigate around obstacles automatically, ensuring a safe and efficient operation. 
In its autonomous mode, the robot can navigate predefined paths, making real-time adjustments based on sensor input to avoid collisions. This feature is particularly useful for applications such as automated plant watering, where the robot can move through a garden and irrigate plants while avoiding obstacles. Additionally, the robot can be utilized as a floor cleaning device, capable of maneuvering around furniture and other objects. The RC Bluetooth app facilitates manual control, allowing users to operate the robot remotely for various tasks. 
The project demonstrates a practical application of renewable energy in robotics, emphasizing the benefits of sustainable energy solutions and versatile operational modes. The use of a wooden platform provides a sturdy base for the robot's components, ensuring durability and reliability. This work contributes to the field of robotics by showcasing how solar power can be effectively harnessed to create energy-efficient, multifunctional robotic systems.
